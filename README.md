# gframework

This is a framework builder for starting new projects, built with C projects in mind.

## Usage

Put gramework\_setup.php into the parent directory of where you want your project repo to be made. For example, if you want your repo to be ~/Documents/myproject, then put gframework\_setup.php into ~/Documents.

Then:
```bash
./gframework_setup.php
```

and follow the onscreen instructions.  

Includes an option to install [GÃ¼T](https://github.com/gavinfielder/gut) unit testing framework.
